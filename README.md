## üîÑ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. **Planning**
- **Objective**: To create a platform that consolidates financial data, enabling users to monitor their spending and achieve financial goals.
- **Scope**:
  - Track expenses and income.
  - Provide insights through reports and charts.
  - Allow users to set financial goals and monitor progress.
- **Stakeholders**: End-users, developers, project manager, finance advisors.
- **Risks**:
  - Data privacy concerns.
  - Complexity of third-party bank API integration.

---

### 2. **Requirements Gathering & Analysis**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - User registration and login.
  - Track and categorize transactions.
  - Generate financial reports (PDF/CSV).
  - Set and monitor financial goals.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:

---

### 3. **Design**
- **System Architecture**:
  - **Frontend**: Single Page Application (SPA) using React.
  - **Backend**: RESTful APIs with Node.js.
  - **Database**: Relational database (PostgreSQL).
- **UI/UX Design**:
  - Wireframes and prototypes in Figma.
  - Responsive and intuitive interface for web and mobile.
- **Database Schema**:
  - Users: `UserID, Name, Email, Password`
  - Transactions: `TransactionID, UserID, Amount, Category, Date`
  - Goals: `GoalID, UserID, GoalName, TargetAmount, Progress`
- **Security**:
  - Password hashing with bcrypt.
  - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
  - TLS encryption for secure communication.

---

### 4. **Development**

  - Git for source code management.
  - CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- **Setup**:
  - Local development with Docker for consistent environments.
  - Linter and formatter tools (ESLint, Prettier).

---

### 5. **Testing**
- **Unit Testing**: Validate individual functions and components using Jest/Mocha.
- **Integration Testing**: Test data flow between frontend and backend.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Gather feedback from real users to ensure usability.
- **Security Testing**: Perform penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Testing**: Stress test to ensure scalability and responsiveness.

---

### 6. **Deployment**
- **Staging Deployment**:
  - Host a staging environment on AWS for final testing.
- **Production Deployment**:
  - Deploy on cloud platforms like AWS/Azure.

## Challenges and Solutions
- *Challenge 1*: Integrating the expense categorization feature with third-party APIs.
  - *Solution*: We implemented a custom API to handle expense categorization, and we used pre-existing libraries to simplify integration with external services.
  
- *Challenge 2*: Ensuring data security for sensitive financial information.
  - *Solution*: We implemented end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data and used JWT for secure authentication.

## Conclusion
*FinGuard* provides a user-friendly, secure, and feature-rich platform to manage personal finances. With a clear development path through the SDLC phases, we ensured the application meets the needs of users while maintaining a high level of security and performance.

We plan to continue improving the dashboard based on user feedback and technological advancements.
